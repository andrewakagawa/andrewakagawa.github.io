# What is BioSpark Innovation?

For our first blog post I wanted to talk about the goals of BioSpark and this blog.  We're somewhere at the intersection of **Healthcare**, **Education**, and **Technology**.

# Why we Exist?

To help contribute to leaving the world a bit healthier and happier than where we found it.

# Hacking for Cause

So, here's where I was thinking to initially go with this blog.  Healthcare and technology can be quite a finicky thing.  Some of our most challenging and terrible healthcare problems never seem to get solved because they are too niche for any market ROI.  **_There is still great value in solving these problems._**  There is value for the people affected and for our educational purposes.  Wouldn't it be interesting if we could forget the ROI for a moment and see how far we could take on these problems as hobby if anything.  And if it happens to turn into a profitable business later, than rock on!

I am a healthcare nerd.  So I will be posting logs of my journeys through different technologies in efforts to help share the knowledge.  I encourage others to do so as well, and we will see what great and amazing things can unfold!

Thanks for reading.  Stay Healthy, Stay Happy.
